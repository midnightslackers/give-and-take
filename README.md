# [Give&Take](http://give-and-take.herokuapp.com) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/midnightslackers/give-and-take.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/midnightslackers/give-and-take)

G&T has a simple goal: to learn from each other. We believe that learning should be fun and free as well as bring people together. G&T is all about community and teaching each other. You get to learn as much as you want - as long as you also teach others.
